nbextractor and SQLite support
==============================

nbextractor can dump its data on screen (standard output) or on a file.
Optionally, nbextractor can dump data on a SQLite database.


In order to enable sqlite3 support:

- install the libsqlite3 library. E.g., in Ubuntu you have to type: 
      sudo apt-get install libsqlite3
      sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev

- change the ENABLE_SQLITE3_SUPPORT flag inside CMakeLists.txt to ON.


After compiling nbextractor, launch 'nbextractor -h' to find out the available
new command line options.
